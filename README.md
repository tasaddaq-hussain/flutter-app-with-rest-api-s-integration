# Flutter app with Rest API's integration

I developed this application, using Flutter and REST API, which seamlessly integrates with the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to provide users with dynamic content. Leveraging Flutter's versatile framework, we've implemented essential features such as pagination and pull-to-refresh functionality. To ensure smooth state management, we've adopted the Provider package, enhancing the app's performance and user experience. With our robust solution, users can enjoy a fluid browsing experience while effortlessly accessing and interacting with the provided content.
